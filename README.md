# HALO 😇

A little bot that tries to take care of you when you're using your Mac. It tells you cute, self care things, and tries not to stress you out.

- If you see a message like: **“halo” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.** You will have to allow your mac to open the app downloaded from other than app store. Or buy me a  $100 apple identification certificate to upload it to app store 😅. Alternatively you can build it from source as well, simply cd into repo and run `npm run build`. Build will be inside dist directory.

- To allow mac to open app go to **System Preferences** -> **Security & Privacy** -> then click Open on blocked app.

- Have some fun, ok?
